## About

"Face to BMI" is a real-time web application that demonstrates face detection and prediction using deep learning techniques. The application streams video from the user's webcam, detects faces in the video stream, and predicts Body Mass Index (BMI) based on the detected faces.

## Demo

[Insert Demo Video or GIF Here]

## Features

- Live video streaming from the user's webcam.
- Real-time face detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier.
- BMI prediction using a trained deep learning model.
- Capture button to capture images from the video stream.
- Immediate display of BMI predictions.
